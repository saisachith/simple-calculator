# simple-calculator


Here I made a simple calculator window using tkinter python.

# Interface of the window.


This is a small example of the output.
(here I did addition of 45 and 23.)

After 45 is entered and when we press the "+" button the previous entry will be cleared from the screen so that the we can enter a new number.

Now as soon as we press "=" then the previous display gets cleared and the result is displayed.
